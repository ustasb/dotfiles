# Brian Ustas's Dot/Configuration Files

## Installing Dotfiles
Run the Rakefile to distribute the .bashrc, .bash_profile, .vimrc and .vim/ into
the home directory.

It will overwrite any equivalents!

## OS X
Import the custom solarized_dark.terminal theme into Terminal.app. It's based off [this][1] and has only been tested on Mountain Lion.
